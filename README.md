## 🧠 Approach Taken

### 1. Component-Driven Design (CDD)
The project starts with atomic UI primitives — `Button`, `Card`, `Section` — establishing a design system before any page-level section is built. This ensures visual consistency and makes future changes low-risk.

### 2. Data & Logic Separation
All static content (navigation links, domain cards, site config) is abstracted into `src/constants/`. React components contain zero hardcoded strings, keeping them purely presentational and easy to maintain or hand off to a CMS.

### 3. Mock API Integration
Rather than hardcoding dynamic sections, a simulated backend is implemented using Next.js Route Handlers (`/api/mock/route.ts`). The `FAQ`, `Testimonials`, and `How We Deliver` components fetch their data asynchronously on mount — directly mirroring a real-world data pipeline and making future CMS or backend swaps trivial.

### 4. Design Fidelity
Generic Tailwind templates were deliberately avoided. Every spacing value, shadow depth, gradient, and hover state was hand-tuned to match Accredian's branded blue/indigo palette and the premium B2B SaaS visual hierarchy of the original site.

## 🤖 AI Usage

AI tools were used strategically to accelerate development without replacing engineering judgment.

### Where AI Helped
- **Component scaffolding** — generating boilerplate for functional components and standard Tailwind grid/flex layouts, which were then heavily customised
- **Mock data generation** — producing realistic JSON structures (FAQs, Testimonials, Delivery Steps) for the `/api/mock` endpoint, seeded from the original site's content
- **Icon mapping** — identifying the best `lucide-react` icons to match the original site's SVG intent

### What Was Done Manually
- **Architecture decisions** — the `src/components/ui`, `src/components/sections`, `src/constants`, and `src/app/api` folder structure was designed manually for scalability, not generated
- **Design refinement** — AI UI output tends toward generic aesthetics; all Tailwind spacing, layered box-shadows, branded color tokens, and transition timing were hand-tweaked to meet a senior frontend bar
- **State & interactivity** — the FAQ accordion and Testimonials custom paginator were written and debugged manually, handling edge cases (empty states, keyboard nav) that AI-generated code missed
- **Responsive layout** — breakpoint decisions and mobile-specific layout overrides were coded manually after testing on real devices

## 🔮 Improvements With More Time

| Priority | Improvement |
|---|---|
| ⭐ Bonus | **Lead Capture Form** — "Request a Callback" modal connected to a Next.js API route, storing leads in Supabase or MongoDB |
| High | **Headless CMS** — Move `src/constants` content into Sanity or Strapi so marketing can self-serve copy updates |
| High | **Performance** — `next/image` with blur placeholders for all remote partner logos and heavy hero assets (improves LCP) |
| Medium | **Testing** — Jest + React Testing Library for FAQ accordion state, Testimonials pagination edge cases, and API fetch error states |
| Low | **Analytics** — Vercel Analytics or PostHog to track CTA click-through and section engagement |

---

## 🧪 Bonus Feature — Lead Capture Form

A "Request a Callback" modal is implemented as a bonus feature. It:
- Renders as a full-page overlay triggered from the sticky CTA
- Validates name, email, phone, and company fields client-side
- Submits to `/api/leads` (Next.js Route Handler)
- Stores the submission in a database
